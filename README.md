# AWS-Solution-For-A-Web-Application

In this excercise I am going to explain the design solution that I would give to the following prompt problem:
"You are part of a DevOps team tasked with designing the infrastructure
for a new web application hosted on AWS. The application must be scalable, secure,
highly available and cost-effective. It consists of a couple of front-end services, some
back-end services, a MySQL database, load balancers, redis, and monitoring services."

For this excersise I've decided to implement a Three-tier architecture solution with Pilot Light Disaster stragedy
