# AWS Solution For A Web Application

## Infrastructure Design Proposal for AWS Web Application Hosting

As part of the infrastructure design for the new web application, I am proposing **two solutions** for hosting the application on AWS. Since it is not yet confirmed whether the application will be built using container images, the two solutions address both possibilities:

1. **Using AWS Fargate**  
   _(For container-based workloads)_  

2. **Using EC2 Instances**  
   _(For traditional virtual machines)_
